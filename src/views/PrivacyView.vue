    <p class="text-p">General Information</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      VPNASAP may collect five (5) types of data depending on your use of the Services, as follows.
      You can find detailed information about each of them in the specific sections below. If you
      are just visiting our Site, please refer to Section 7.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      (i) Personal data submitted in association with your Account (“Personal Data”)
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Personal Data means any information that can be used, alone or combined with other data, to
      uniquely identify an individual. Personal Data is collected for the purpose of providing you
      with our Services, including preventing fraudulent signups or account hijacking, and may
      include the name, email address, and payment information that you submit to us when you create
      or update your Account.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      (ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics (“Usage Statistics Data”)
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      A minimal amount of Usage Statistics Data is collected in order to maintain excellent customer
      support and quality of service. This type of data does not include information about users’
      browsing and internet activity, including while connected to the VPN—we do not collect (and
      therefore do not use, disclose, or store) data about the content or destinations of VPN
      traffic, DNS queries, or user IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      (iii) Data added to VPNASAP Keys (“Keys Data”) (applicable only to VPNASAP Keys users)
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Keys Data refers to all the data stored within the VPNASAP Keys associated with your Account,
      which may include user logins and passwords to your services and accounts, as well as other
      types of data you choose to store. Keys Data is encrypted the moment you add it to VPNASAP
      Keys, and we are not capable of viewing, decrypting, or accessing Keys Data under any
      circumstance (even if you want us to). You may add, modify, and delete your Keys Data at any
      time by accessing your VPNASAP Keys dashboard.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      (iv) Anonymous App diagnostics, including crash reports (“App Diagnostic Data”) (optional)
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      App Diagnostic Data, which includes crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection
      diagnostics, is anonymized data that cannot be tied back to individual users. This feature is
      similar to a “send bug report” option. App Diagnostic Data is not shared by default. You must
      opt in, such as through the settings menu of your Apps, to send App Diagnostic Data to us.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      (v) IP addresses authorized to use MediaStreamer Services (“MediaStreamer Data”) (applicable
      only to MediaStreamer users)
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Separately from VPN services, we also provide our optional MediaStreamer service for devices
      that do not support VPNs (e.g., Roku). Users who opt in to using MediaStreamer can choose to
      register specific IP addresses that should be authorized to use the service. These IP
      addresses are only used by VPNASAP to provide the optional MediaStreamer service and not for
      any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Personal Data</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      VPNASAP collects Personal Data that you provide by creating or updating an Account. We require
      Personal Data, such as an email address and payment information, so that we can provide you
      with our Services, email you, collect payments and corresponding taxes, prevent fraud, respond
      to support queries, and share relevant information about your Account and/or the Services.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Specific Personal Data collected will depend on the payment method you choose and may include
      information such as name, billing country, billing address, and/or credit card number. For
      some forms of payment, you may be redirected to external websites operated by third-party
      payment processors (e.g., PayPal, BitPay, Paymentwall, Stripe, or other specific payment
      processors, depending on your location) to complete the transaction. To understand what
      personal data these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's
      terms and privacy policy. Payment methods that help to minimize the amount of Personal Data
      you submit to us, such as Bitcoin, are also available for you to use to subscribe to our
      Services. In addition, we engage with trusted partners for the purposes of simplifying the
      login process, detecting fraudulent signups, and preventing account hijacking. These partners
      may obtain user IP addresses, but these addresses are always stored separately from systems
      unrelated to these purposes; can never be connected to the online behavior of any user,
      because no record of any such behavior is collected; and are always permanently deleted after
      30 days.

    <p class="text-p">
      VPNASAP uses your Personal Data only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we do
      not sell or lease your Personal Data to third parties. We collect and process your Personal
      Data for legitimate interest under the applicable law, more specifically to fulfill our
      contractual obligations to you (i.e., according to the Agreement between you and VPNASAP).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Any personal information associated with VPNASAP accounts is controlled only by VPNASAP,
      including being stored on systems, servers, and services owned or leased by VPNASAP and its
      subsidiaries. In the limited circumstances where this data may need to be processed by other
      related entities, it may be shared only when required, and for the duration required, for
      processing solely related to the purposes and legitimate interests outlined in this Privacy
      Policy, while ensuring at all times the same data protection standards. For avoidance of
      doubt, these circumstances do not include any situations where control of personal information
      of VPNASAP users will be transferred to any other related entities, including but not limited
      to our ultimate holding company, Seat Gate s.r.o. , for any duration of time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">How We Protect and Retain Your Personal Data</p>
    <div class="text-p">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Security. We have implemented best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security
          measures with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent
          any loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your Personal
          Data. Although we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no
          data security measures in the world can offer completely infallible protection. For this
          reason, our guiding principle is to collect minimal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Servers and data centers. Servers are housed in data centers with strong security
          practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or
          Personal Data related to your use of the Services. If any data center were to ask us to
          log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said service provider and find
          alternative options. Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers,
          there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular
          event, website, or behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          Retention of your Personal Data. Your Personal Data—which, to reiterate, never includes
          any sensitive data such as browsing history, DNS queries, or IP addresses linked to that
          information or any other online behavior—is retained for a limited period in accordance
          with applicable data protection law (for as long as we have your consent or a legitimate
          reason for holding such data). You may request to have your data deleted by sending a
          valid deletion request (please see Section 11). Please note that if you request the
          deletion of your Personal Data, you will as a result no longer be able to use the
          Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legal. Your Personal Data is controlled by and stored under VPNASAP, and not by its
          ultimate holding company, Seat Gate s.r.o. or other related entities. Seat Gate s.r.o.
          operates under Czech Republic jurisdiction, in accordance with Czech Republic laws
          (pursuant to Section 16 of the Terms). Consequently, any demand via legal means for
          Personal Data (or other types of data) is subject to Czech Republic jurisdiction and laws.
          We fight vigorously to defend our rights (and those of our users) if an attempt is made to
          bypass the privacy protections provided for by the Czech Republic. A parent, subsidiary,
          or related entity cannot be compelled to, nor would it voluntarily, provide Personal Data
          stored by Seat Gate s.r.o.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-p">How We Safeguard Your Personal Data With Relation to Service Providers</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Agents, contractors, and third-party service providers of VPNASAP (“Service Providers”) may
      have controlled access to relevant data to help us process payments, administer the Services,
      and otherwise assist us in operating our business. All Service Providers who may gain access
      to such data have confidentiality and data processing obligations to keep the data
      confidential and not use them for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are
      performing on behalf of VPNASAP. These obligations include contractual commitments to protect
      data as required by applicable laws, including those covering the transfer of Personal Data
      from the European Union / European Economic Area to a third country.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Service Providers only have access to the data necessary for the services they are performing
      on behalf of VPNASAP, which in any case will never include VPN activity or connection data as
      we do not collect such data.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      In addition to Service Providers, we may share your Personal Data where you have provided your
      consent to us for sharing or transferring your Personal Data (e.g., marketing consents or
      opt-in to optional additional services or functionality).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, VPNASAP collects
      certain information related to your VPN usage, as described below. The data we collect for
      this purpose is visible to our staff strictly on a need-to-know basis, and may be shared with
      Service Providers for the purposes above, but is kept confidential at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      We ensure that Usage Statistics Data and App Diagnostic Data never include any sensitive
      information, in line with our overall commitment to never logging browsing history, traffic
      destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      With regard to VPN Usage Statistics, our principle of minimal data collection means that:
    </p>
    <div class="text-p">
      <ul>
        <li>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</li>
        <li>
          We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server
          IP addresses they used.
        </li>
        <li>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of any given user’s computer.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-p">
      Should anyone try to compel VPNASAP to release user information based on any of the above, we
      cannot supply this information because the data does not exist.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Apps and Apps versions</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated in order
      to use our Services. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our Support Team to
      troubleshoot technical issues you may encounter.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Successful connection</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      As you use the App, we collect information about whether you have successfully established a
      VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location
      (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source
      IP address). This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as
      identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our
      Services, and enabling VPNASAP engineers to identify and fix network issues.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. Although
      we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than
      thousands of others combined, thereby affecting the quality of Services for other VPNASAP
      users, we may contact that user for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">Usage Statistics Data summary</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      In summary, we collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. We may
      know, for example, that our customer John had connected to our New York VPN location on
      Tuesday and transferred an aggregate of 823 MB of data across a 24-hour period. John can’t be
      uniquely identified as responsible for any specific online behavior because his usage pattern
      overlaps with thousands of other VPNASAP customers who also connected to the same location on
      the same day.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We may know
      THAT a user has used VPNASAP, but we are unable to single out the user and we never know HOW
      they have utilized our Service. We stand by our firm commitment to our users’ privacy by not
      possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">App Diagnostic Data</p>
    <p class="text-p">
      With your opt-in permission, we collect anonymized App Diagnostic Data, which includes crash
      reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics. We use this data in our
      network operations tools to help optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems and
      areas for improvement related to specific apps, VPN servers, or internet service providers
      (ISPs). This App Diagnostic Data we receive is&nbsp;fully anonymized and cannot be tied back
      to individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store
      user IP addresses).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      If you opt in to share this information with VPNASAP (in the settings menu of your Account),
      we will collect the following anonymized App Diagnostics Data:
    </p>
    <div class="text-p">
      <ul>
        <li>Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.</li>
        <li>Speed test data.</li>
        <li>
          App diagnostics, including crash reports and usability diagnostics, without any personally
          identifiable information. These are handled in an anonymized form by the following Service
          Providers bound by non-disclosure and other contractual obligations, dependent on the
          platform you are using VPNASAP on:
        </li>
        <li>
          iOS: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Apple. See Apple’s Privacy Policy and
          Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation. You can disable Apple’s crash reporting in
          iOS settings as described here.
        </li>
        <li>
          Android: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google. See Firebase’s Privacy and Security
          documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-p">
      Upon activation of any of our Apps, you will be asked if you would like to share App
      Diagnostics Data with VPNASAP. You can start or stop sharing this data at any time in your
      App’s settings menu. On iOS, Apple’s crash reporting can be turned off in iOS settings.
    </p>

      How We Protect and Retain Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      VPNASAP keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit
      to us through our Site or Services, along with our response. Depending on how you contact
      VPNASAP, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us.
      Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer
      support experience.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      We use two different third-party platforms for support correspondence: Zendesk for emails and
      support tickets and TeamSupport for live chat. When you correspond with us using these
      platforms, they will store your correspondence records—including your email address, as well
      as user and device attributes that help with troubleshooting, such as the country you are
      contacting us from and your device’s operating system. Both platforms utilize modern security
      practices and SSL encryption. See Zendesk’s Privacy Notice and TeamSupport’s Privacy Policy.
