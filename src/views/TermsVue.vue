    <p class="text-p">
      Our Services are available to you upon registering an account (the “Account”) on the Site or
      the Apps. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) for
      the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the
      Site. Seat Gate s.r.o. reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at
      any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site, on your Account, or sent via
      email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period
      and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are
      handled via multiple third-party payment companies. To find out more about these third-party
      payment companies and how they process your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion
      of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term
      for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the
      payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may
      do so via your Account or email us at hello@vpnasapcom. By default, auto-renewal is turned on
      when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or PayPal),
      and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as
      Bitcoin).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Each paid monthly subscription grants you one (1) license to use our VPN Service on up to
      eight (8) different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than
      eight (8) devices at a time, then you can either (i) use VPNASAP on your router, (ii) purchase
      additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the “volume
      licensing” option. For more information on our “volume licensing” program, please contact

    <p class="text-p">
      You may cancel your Account for any reason within thirty (30) calendar days of your initial
      purchase and you will receive a full refund of the amount you paid (“Money Back Guarantee”).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of Seat
      Gate s.r.o., if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Services were not available or usable
      during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Seat Gate
      s.r.o. to resolve the issue. In this case, Seat Gate s.r.o. may provide the Subscriber with a
      pro-rata refund of Service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or
      usable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of
      payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could
      differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin (e.g., due to foreign
      exchange and processing charges linked to your method of payment).
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or
      purchasing of additional licenses under the same Account, shall constitute a waiver of the
      Money Back Guarantee option. To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email
      with your request to the following email address: hello@vpnasap.com
    </p>
    <p class="text-p">
      Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store
      (iTunes) do not have access to the Seat Gate s.r.o. 30-day Money Back Guarantee. Instead,
      users can request refunds through the Apple App Store, which are issued solely at the
      discretion of Apple Support.
