      mobile and web versions) (the &ldquo;Apps&rdquo;), as well as all content (the
      &ldquo;Content&rdquo;) and software (the &ldquo;Software&rdquo;) associated with our services
      (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
      These Terms and the Privacy Policy (together, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) constitute a
      legally binding agreement between you and Seat Gate s.r.o., so please read them carefully.
    </p>
    <p>1. Acceptance</p>

      By using and/or accessing the Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you
      represent (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) to comply with and to be legally bound by these Terms and the
      Privacy Policy in their entirety, including to be responsible for any charges arising from
      your use of the Services.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>

      the Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand the Agreement; and (iii) you agree and

    </p>
    <p>
      Some sections of these Terms or the Privacy Policy may not apply to your specific use of the

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>2. Modification</p>
    <p>
      Seat Gate s.r.o. may update these Terms from time to time without notice. Unless it is
      otherwise stated by us, each update of the Terms comes into force as of the moment the amended
      Terms are published on the Site. If you continue to use the Services after these changes take
      effect, then you agree and consent to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is
      available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these
      Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations.

    </p>
    <p>3. Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>
      Seat Gate s.r.o. is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history,
      traffic destination, data content, DNS queries, or user-linked IP addresses from Subscribers
      connected to our Services. During your registration, we may collect some personal information,
      such as your name, email address and payment information. We only collect such information as
      is strictly necessary for the proper delivery of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find detailed information related to data collection in the Privacy Policy. Please
      review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your
      information, your rights, our rights, as well as our commitment to data protection.
    </p>
    <p>4. Subscriptions</p>

    <p>
      Our Services are available to you upon registering an account (the &ldquo;Account&rdquo;) on
      the Site or the Apps. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber
      (&ldquo;Subscriber&rdquo;) for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans
      and pricing is available on the Site. Seat Gate s.r.o. reserves the right to amend
      subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on
      the Site, on your Account, or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the
      Subscriber&rsquo;s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription
      renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment
      companies. To find out more about these third-party payment companies and how they process
      your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion
      of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term
      for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the
      payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may
      do so via your Account or email us at&nbsp;hello@vpnasapcom. By default, auto-renewal is
      turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or
      PayPal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such
      as Bitcoin).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each paid monthly subscription grants you one (1) license to use our VPN Service on up to
      eight (8) different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than
      eight (8) devices at a time, then you can either (i) use VPNASAP on your router, (ii) purchase
      additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the &ldquo;volume
      licensing&rdquo; option. For more information on our &ldquo;volume licensing&rdquo; program,
      please contact Support at&nbsp;hello@vpnasap.com
    </p>
    <p>5. Refund Policy</p>
    <p>
      You may cancel your Account for any reason within thirty (30) calendar days of your initial
      purchase and you will receive a full refund of the amount you paid (&ldquo;Money Back
      Guarantee&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of Seat
      Gate s.r.o., if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Services were not available or usable
      during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Seat Gate
      s.r.o. to resolve the issue. In this case, Seat Gate s.r.o. may provide the Subscriber with a
      pro-rata refund of Service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or
      usable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of
      payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could
      differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin (e.g., due to foreign
      exchange and processing charges linked to your method of payment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or
      purchasing of additional licenses under the same Account, shall constitute a waiver of the
      Money Back Guarantee option. To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email
      with your request to the following email address:&nbsp;hello@vpnasap.com
    </p>
    <p>
      Users whose subscriptions are billed as an&nbsp;in-app purchase&nbsp;through the Apple App
      Store (iTunes) do not have access to the Seat Gate s.r.o. 30-day Money Back Guarantee.
      Instead, users can request refunds through the Apple App Store, which are issued solely at the
      discretion of&nbsp;Apple Support.

    </p>
    <p>
      The Application is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all

      permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf
      of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
      providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
      non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing,
      course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
      foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
      representation of any kind that the Application will meet your requirements,
      achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
      applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
      performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or

    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties
      or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of
      the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case
      the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to
      the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any
      warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be
      solely responsible for such warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limitation of Liability
    </p>

      Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the
      Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and
      your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount
      actually paid by You for the Application or through the Application or 100 USD
      if You haven't purchased anything through the Application.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
      Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or
      consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for
      loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
      for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to
      the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or
      third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in connection
      with any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
      of its essential purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
      incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
      not apply to You.

      Waiver
    </p>
    <p>

      Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
      performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party's
      ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
      thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
